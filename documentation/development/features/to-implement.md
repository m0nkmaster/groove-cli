# Backlog (Ideas)

This is a lightweight list of ideas that are not yet implemented. Keep it honest: if something ships, remove it from here (or move it to “Done” elsewhere).

## High-impact

- **Pattern semantics**: nudge, cycle conditions, param locks (parsed today, ignored in playback)
- **AI**: make suggestions respect `Song.steps` and optionally return multiple patterns in a structured way
- **TUI safety**: prevent REPL-only commands (`:live`, `clear`, interactive browse) from corrupting the TUI

## Audio / sequencing

- **Long sample handling**: loops, stop-at-bar, and better scheduling for long sources
- **Meters**: per-track and master peak/RMS in the TUI
- **More FX**: reverb, filter, saturation (with a clean routing model)

## UX

- **Better error messages**: consistent “usage:” hints, plus suggestions for typos
- **Richer sample browsing in TUI**: optional in-app browser/picker (without leaving full-screen mode)
