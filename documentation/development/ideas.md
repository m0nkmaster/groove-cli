# Ideas 

Some ideas that it would be good to flesh out and potentially use at some point.

## Kits and synths differentiate between the two types of device which means you can have different ways of creating patterns etc. Stuff like musical notation, actually specifying notes and chords for the synth tracks. Pitch detection of samples.

## Synth
Full-blown synthesizer that we have settings rather than using a sample for all instruments.
