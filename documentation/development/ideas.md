# Ideas 

Some ideas that it would be good to flesh out and potentially use at some point.

## Kits and synths differentiate between the two types of device which means you can have different ways of creating patterns etc. Stuff like musical notation, actually specifying notes and chords for the synth tracks. Pitch detection of samples.

## Synth
Full-blown synthesizer that we have settings rather than using a sample for all instruments.

## Quanisation

Simple

## Transition waiting

The ability to change sequences at the end of a loop instead of instantly. Probably have this as the default.

## UI sparkles

* `>` = play
* `<` = step back so all tracks are on beat 1
* ai gen shows a thinking icon
* "Macros" i.e. create a one word action e.g. `chorus` which runs a longer chain of commands, something like `synth > chorus;kick > fill;lead mute; bass > chorus`
* Visually showing all variations in the TUI e.g. a column showing `MAIN | FILL | BRIDGE | OUTRO` for a track. The currently selected track is highlighted
* Wildcard track selection to allow big transitions, e.g. `* > chorus` or `*piano* bridge`
